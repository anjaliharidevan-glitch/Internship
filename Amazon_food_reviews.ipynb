They are 33% protein, 9% Omega 3, and GLA.  I think the MSRP on these bags is $14 each so Amazon has these priced at almost half-price!  This is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats.<br /><br />Amazon sent me very fresh product.  I subscribed-n-saved on July 22nd and it arrived via OnTrac on July 24th.  The Nutiva Hempseed package says it was packed on may 19, 2012 and is best before may 18, 2013.  Pretty fresh product and tastes fresh, too.<br /><br />Sprinkle on top of your  cereal, omelets, yogurt, soups, salads, and veggies.<br /><br />Hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit.<br /><br />Here is a great way to enjoy Hemp:<br />1cup hemp seeds<br />1 cup spring water<br />1Tbsp maple syrup, honey, stevia, or your favorite sweetneer<br />dash himalyan salt<br />optional flavoriing = cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, cardamom<br /><br />Combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms.  Pour through a strainer to remove any husk residue.  Will keep in refrigerator for 4-5 days but I recommend preparing small batches right when you want to drink them as fresh is the most tasty and most nutritious.  You could also make a great milk out of <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084QP4T4\\\">Cinnamon Red Maca Almond Butter</a>\",\n          \"Ugh.<br /><br />We've been buying Happy Hips treats for our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix for about a year because they are SO beneficial for her arthritis.  We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh, my gosh!<br /><br />The dog LOVES these treats!  She's ready to put on a tu-tu and prance around the kitchen to beg for them.  Forget the dignity afforded to canine senior citizens - this pooch is acting like her old juvenile self!  I don't know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won't go away!  Every time I turn around she's at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other \\\"flavors\\\" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like \\\"beef jerky\\\" - nope!  They're real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they're almost crystalline).  There's no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it's sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I'll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn't smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn't do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don't know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn't hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.

It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch. |\n",

They are 33% protein, 9% Omega 3, and GLA.  I think the MSRP on these bags is $14 each so Amazon has these priced at almost half-price!  This is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats.<br /><br />Amazon sent me very fresh product.  I subscribed-n-saved on July 22nd and it arrived via OnTrac on July 24th.  The Nutiva Hempseed package says it was packed on may 19, 2012 and is best before may 18, 2013.  Pretty fresh product and tastes fresh, too.<br /><br />Sprinkle on top of your  cereal, omelets, yogurt, soups, salads, and veggies.<br /><br />Hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit.<br /><br />Here is a great way to enjoy Hemp:<br />1cup hemp seeds<br />1 cup spring water<br />1Tbsp maple syrup, honey, stevia, or your favorite sweetneer<br />dash himalyan salt<br />optional flavoriing = cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, cardamom<br /><br />Combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms.  Pour through a strainer to remove any husk residue.  Will keep in refrigerator for 4-5 days but I recommend preparing small batches right when you want to drink them as fresh is the most tasty and most nutritious.  You could also make a great milk out of <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084QP4T4\\\">Cinnamon Red Maca Almond Butter</a>\",\n          \"Ugh.<br /><br />We've been buying Happy Hips treats for our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix for about a year because they are SO beneficial for her arthritis.  We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh, my gosh!<br /><br />The dog LOVES these treats!  She's ready to put on a tu-tu and prance around the kitchen to beg for them.  Forget the dignity afforded to canine senior citizens - this pooch is acting like her old juvenile self!  I don't know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won't go away!  Every time I turn around she's at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other \\\"flavors\\\" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like \\\"beef jerky\\\" - nope!  They're real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they're almost crystalline).  There's no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it's sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I'll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn't smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn't do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don't know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn't hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.
